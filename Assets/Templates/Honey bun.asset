  FlavorText: "{NAME} is the darling of dessert lovers and social butterflies. It\u2019s
    known for sweet vibes and contagious laughter, with whispers that it once caused
    a bake sale to run out of snacks in record time. With every toke, the world feels
    a little softer and the company a bit warmer; enough to go kick some Hunny buns."
